            <p>This is a site with answers for CodeHS, specifically the A.P. Computer Science A lessons.</p>
            <p>It&apos;s originally for my high school&apos;s curriculum, but it seems like some other people might like it too.
                nice!</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <h3>Is this legal?? Like, taking stuff from CodeHS?</h3>
            <p>Yep! Check out the <a href="/legal/fairuse">Fair Use Statement</a></p>

            <h3>Do you track users?</h3>
            <p>I&apos;ve got a custom page analytics script based on <a href="https://matomo.org">Matomo</a>. It only records
                the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>Someone viewed a page</li>
                <li>The address of the page that was viewed</li>
                <li>How quickly the page loaded</li>
                <li>What browser/OS you used</li>
                <li>Your general location (i.e. region of the country)</li>
            </ul>
            Your IP address is not saved, and no cookies are used. I don&apos;t sell your data. No personally identifiable
            information is recorded, ever. I don&apos;t want your information. Keep that stuff to yourself, man :/

            <h3>My teacher gave me a challenge that isn&apos;t on here-- huh?</h3>
            <p>Some teachers have implemented their own challenges on CodeHS. I don&apos;t have those unique challenges,
                sorry; I&apos;d be glad to help you with them, though!</p>
            <p>If you have a question that Dinner Coding Time can&apos;t answer, please ask it on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.gg/m2Zub6EYyp">the Discord</a>! I might not be able to answer
                it right away, but someone should be able to help you ASAP.</p>
