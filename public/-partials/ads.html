            <h1>Ads Policy</h1>
            <p>Every single ad on this website follows 3 requirements:</p>

            <h2>Static</h2>
            <p>When ads are static, there&apos;s nothing going on in the background: no third-party servers being connected to; no tracking pixels; no adversisers&apos; JavaScript code being ran on your computer.</p>
            <p>You don&apos;t have to worry about tracking or resource-heavy ads being loaded without consent.</p>

            <h2>Good-Faith</h2>
            <p>Ads are confined to their own lil&apos; box. No pop-ups, popunders, or sticky banner ads exist on this site.</p>
            <p>They&apos;re not going to pretend to <em>not</em> be ads. They might even be useful!</p>

            <h2>Approved</h2>
            <p>Every ad is individually approved. By a human. We&apos;re not gonna approve any inappropriate ads. :)</p>

            <h2>Why Run Ads?</h2>
            <p>Because running the website costs money. and i am not made of money. so i need money somehow. and nobody donated so i&apos;m running ethical ads :)</p>
