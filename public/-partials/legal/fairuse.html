        <h2>Fair Use Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Fair use is a doctrine in United States copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material
            without requiring permission from the rights holders, such as commentary, criticism, news reporting,
            research, teaching or scholarship. It provides for the legal, non-licensed citation or incorporation of
            copyrighted material in another author’s work under a four-factor balancing test.
